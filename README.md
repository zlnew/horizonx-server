# go-monitor-agent

Lightweight Linux metrics agent that scrapes `/proc` and `/sys` once per second and exposes a JSON snapshot at `/metrics`. Collectors are defensive: unreadable files just zero the value so the agent keeps running.

## Requirements

- Go 1.25.4+.
- Linux host with `/proc` and `/sys` available.
- Optional kernel interfaces/sensors:
  - RAPL or hwmon power/temperature files for CPU and GPU.
  - `/sys/class/drm/*/gpu_busy_percent` and `mem_info_vram_*` for GPU utilization and VRAM.
  - NVMe hwmon temperature for disk temperature.
- Missing files are tolerated; collectors will emit zero values instead of failing.

## Run, build, test

- Run locally: `go run ./cmd/agent` (binds to `:3000`).
- Configure address: set `HTTP_ADDR` in the env or a `.env` file, e.g. `HTTP_ADDR=:8080`.
- Build: `go build -o bin/monitor-agent ./cmd/agent` or `make build`.
- Clean build artifact: `make clean`.
- Tests: `go test ./...` (none yet).

## Metrics

Collectors refresh every second and degrade gracefully when inputs are unreadable.

- CPU: usage and per-core usage percent (averaged since boot from `/proc/stat`), temperature via hwmon CPU sensors, current frequency (MHz) from cpufreq, and `power_watt` from RAPL or hwmon when available.
- GPU: discovers DRM cards under `/sys/class/drm/card*` (skips render nodes) and reports vendor/model (using PCI IDs where possible), per-card name, `core_usage_percent` from `gpu_busy_percent`, VRAM total/used/percent from `mem_info_vram_*`, temperature/power from hwmon, and `fan_speed_percent` when PWM or fan RPM are readable. Still returned as a slice even for a single GPU.
- Memory: total, available, used, and swap total/free/used in GiB from `/proc/meminfo`.
- Disk: enumerates block devices under `/sys/class/block` (skips loop/ram/dm). For each disk it reports `raw_size_gb` and temperature via `/sys/block/<disk>/device` hwmon, plus per-filesystem usage for each mounted partition discovered in `/proc/self/mountinfo`. Filesystem entries include device name, mountpoint, total/used/free, and percent used.
- Network: aggregate of non-loopback interfaces from `/proc/net/dev` with cumulative `rx_bytes`/`tx_bytes` and Mbps rates computed between samples (first sample reports `0` speeds).
- Uptime: `uptime_seconds` from `/proc/uptime`.

### Endpoint

## Notes

- The HTTP server runs until process exit; the scheduler stops when context is canceled.
- Build artifacts land in `bin/`; avoid committing binaries unless intentional.
